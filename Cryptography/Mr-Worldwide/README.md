# Mr-Worldwide
A musician left us a [message](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/46e165b0a953075440f3a544fdb4cff1/message.txt). What's it mean?

# Hints
None

# Details
Completed: *During challenge*  
flag: `picoCTF{KODIAK_ALANKA}`

# Solution
The message in the text file may look like global coordinates in the form (longitude, latitude)  
When searching for each of these coordinates, they give a particular geographic location (usually a capital city)  
You can get the flag when you replace each of the coordinates by the first letter of the city name.
