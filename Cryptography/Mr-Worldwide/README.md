# Mr-Worldwide
A musician left us a [message](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/46e165b0a953075440f3a544fdb4cff1/message.txt). What's it mean?

Worth 200 points.

## Hints
None

## Solution
The message in the text file may look like global coordinates in the form (longitude, latitude)  
When searching for each of these coordinates, they give a particular geographic location (usually a capital city)  
You can get the flag when you replace each of the coordinates by the first letter of the city name.
