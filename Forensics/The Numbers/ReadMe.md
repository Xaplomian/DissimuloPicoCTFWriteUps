# The Numbers
The numbers... what do they mean?

# Hint
The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}

# Solution
The numbers are: '16 9 3 15 3 20 6 {20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14}'

The numbers represent each letter's position in the alphabet. From the hint we can deduce that all the letters are capital.

When these numbers are converted we get: 'PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}'
