# Problem title
The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key. Can you solve this? We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO. Can you use this table to solve it?.

# Hint
Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{HELLO}' as the flag.
Please use all caps for the message.

# Solution
This is a vigenere cipher, simply put in the flag and key into this website https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher
