# where are the robots
Can you find the robots? `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47235/` [(link)](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47235/) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:47235

## Hint
What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution
The title 'Where are the ROBOTS' and the hint both imply to look at robots.txt  
This leads to the subdomain [robots.txt](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47235/robots.txt)

Containing ```User-agent: *
Disallow: /54e98.html```
This brings you to [54e98.html](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47235/54e98.html), giving you the flag
