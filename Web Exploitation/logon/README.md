# logon
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. 
Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? 
`https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32270/` 
([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32270/)) or ht<span>t</span>p://2019shell1.picoctf.com:32270

## Hint
Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for {{name}}'s?

## Solution
I didn't really use the hint. I tried to logon to the [main page](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32270/)    
Any username and password works for this page.  

At this point, it sets the cookies admin, username, password
```
admin=False
username=Ryan
password=cyrilstupid
```

Next step: set admin to True and reloaded page  
Yay! You have recieved the flag in big red bold letters
