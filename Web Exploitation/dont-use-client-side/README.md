## Hint
Never trust the client

## Solution
The hint `Never trust the client`, should lead to to inpsecting the client.
Below is the password verification code, which is *unexpectedly* being done on the public side.

```javascript
function verify() {
    checkpass = document.getElementById("pass").value;
    split = 4;
    if (checkpass.substring(0, split) == 'pico') {
      if (checkpass.substring(split*6, split*7) == '6a8e') {
        if (checkpass.substring(split, split*2) == 'CTF{') {
         if (checkpass.substring(split*4, split*5) == 'ts_p') {
          if (checkpass.substring(split*3, split*4) == 'lien') {
            if (checkpass.substring(split*5, split*6) == 'lz_5') {
              if (checkpass.substring(split*2, split*3) == 'no_c') {
                if (checkpass.substring(split*7, split*8) == 'b}') {
                  alert("Password Verified")
                  }
                }
              }
      
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    else {
      alert("Incorrect password");
```

You can replace every instance of split with the number 4 to make it easier to read.  
In psuedocode, the password is valid if:
 - starts with `pico`
 - follwed by `CTF{`
 - followed by `no_c`
 - followed by `lien`
 - followed by `ts_p`
 - followed by `lz_5`
 - followed by `6a8e`
 - followed by `b}`

thus you have found yor flag!
