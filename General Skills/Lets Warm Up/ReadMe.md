# Lets Warm Up
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?
## Hint
Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

## Solution
If we look at an ASCII table we can see that 0x70 = 'p'.
